Used a for loop to iterate through the list\n3. Printed each fruit with its position number (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - not 0, 1, 2, 3, 4)\n4. Calculated the length of the list using len()\n5. Printed the total count\n\nGive points for each requirement met. The code should run without errors. Award full points (100) if all requirements are perfectly met. Award 70+ for mostly correct code with minor issues. Deduct points for missing elements, incorrect indexing, or syntax errors."}
