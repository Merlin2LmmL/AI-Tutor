{"id":"exercise_1","title":"Variables and Data Types","description":"Learn about Python variables and basic data types","question":"Write a Python program that:\n1. Creates a variable called 'name' and assigns it your name as a string\n2. Creates a variable called 'age' and assigns it your age as an integer\n3. Creates a variable called 'height' and assigns it your height in meters as a float\n4. Prints all three variables with descriptive labels","materials":[{"type":"link","title":"Python Variables Tutorial","content":"https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables.asp"},{"type":"link","title":"Python Data Types","content":"https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datatypes.asp"},{"type":"text","content":"Remember: Strings use quotes, integers are whole numbers, floats have decimals"}],"grading_instructions":"There are 4 REQUIRED requirements. Check each one systematically:\n\nREQUIREMENT 1: Variable 'name' must exist and be assigned a string value (text in quotes like \"Merlin\" or 'Merlin').\nREQUIREMENT 2: Variable 'age' must exist and be assigned an integer value (whole number without quotes like 16).\nREQUIREMENT 3: Variable 'height' must exist and be assigned a float value (decimal number without quotes like 1.75).\nREQUIREMENT 4: Must have print() statements that PRINT THE VARIABLES (name, age, height) with descriptive labels. The variables must APPEAR IN the print statements - e.g. print(f\"My name is {name}.\"), print(f\"I am {age} years old\"), print(f\"I am {height}m tall\"). If print statements use hardcoded values instead (e.g. print(f\"My name is Merlin\") or print(f\"I am 16 years old\") with no variable inside), requirement 4 is NOT MET - they are not printing the variables, just literal text.\n\nSTRICT SCORING (follow exactly):\n- Syntax errors: 0-20 points (FAIL)\n- All 4 requirements met: 90-100 points (PASS)\n- 3 requirements met (1 missing): MAXIMUM 60 points (FAIL - score < 70)\n- 2 requirements met (2 missing): MAXIMUM 40 points (FAIL)\n- 1 requirement met (3 missing): MAXIMUM 20 points (FAIL)\n- 0 requirements met: 0-10 points (FAIL)\n\nCRITICAL: Missing ANY requirement = automatic FAIL (score < 70). Do NOT give passing scores if requirements are missing.\n\nIMPORTANT: Only suggest improvements for requirements that are ACTUALLY missing. If the code already has descriptive labels in print statements, do NOT suggest adding them."}
